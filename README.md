# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis:
## Introduction:
The hospitality industry faces significant challenges due to booking cancellations, which directly impact revenue, occupancy rates, and resource allocation. This project analyzes hotel booking and cancellation data to identify patterns, reasons, and insights that can help hotels improve their services and reduce cancellation rates.
## Objectives:
1. To analyze total bookings and cancellations.
2. To compare booking and cancellation trends between City Hotels and Resort Hotels.
3. To study month-wise and year-wise booking and cancellation patterns.
4. To analyze guest type and room type data to identify cancellation behavior.
5. To provide recommendations that can help reduce cancellations and improve hotel business performance.
## Dataset used:
-<a href="https://github.com/CharuGupta25/Hotel_Booking_Cancellation_Dashboard/blob/main/hotel_bookings.csv">Hotel Booking Dataset</a>
## Key Questions:
1. What is the total number of bookings and cancellations?
2. Which type of hotel (City or Resort) faces higher cancellations?
3. In which months do most cancellations occur?
4. Which guest type cancels the most (Couples, Families, Singles)?
5. Which room types are most affected by cancellations?
6. How has the cancellation trend changed across years (2015, 2016, 2017)?
7. What is the overall cancellation ratio compared to total bookings?

## Insights (Findings from Dashboard):
-Total Bookings: 1,19,391

-Total Cancellations: 44,224

-Overall cancellation rate is approximately 37%, which is quite high.
## Hotel Type:
City Hotels have more bookings compared to Resort Hotels.
However, City Hotels also face higher cancellation rates.
## Monthly Trend:
Peak season (July–August) shows the highest number of bookings.
The same months also record maximum cancellations.
Off-season months (November–January) have fewer cancellations.
## Guest Type:
Couples make the maximum number of bookings.
Families show a higher cancellation percentage compared to Couples.
Singles have the least bookings and cancellations.
## Room Type:
Standard and "desired but not allotted" rooms show the highest cancellation ratio.
Undefined room type bookings also face significant cancellations.
## Year-wise Trend:
Cancellations peaked in 2016.
Slight improvement is seen in 2017, but the rate still remains high.
## Outcomes (Recommendations):
1. Flexible Cancellation Policies:
Hotels should adopt flexible cancellation policies during peak seasons to retain customers.
2. Revenue Protection:
Advance deposits or partial prepayments can be introduced to reduce last-minute cancellations.
3. Hotel-Specific Strategies:
City Hotels: Implement stricter cancellation rules due to higher cancellation trends.
Resort Hotels: Offer promotional discounts and packages to attract more stable bookings.
4. Guest Type Focus:
Since Families cancel more often, special family packages with non-refundable benefits can help.
5. Room Allocation Improvement:
Proper inventory management should be introduced to avoid dissatisfaction regarding “desired room not allotted,” which leads to cancellations.
6. Business Value:
This analysis helps hotel managers in forecasting demand, improving customer satisfaction, and minimizing revenue loss.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how cancellations significantly affect hotel revenue and occupancy. By analyzing booking data across hotels, months, years, guest types, and room categories, it is evident that certain patterns can be targeted with better strategies. With improved policies, promotional offers, and efficient room management, hotels can reduce cancellations and enhance profitability.
